Calibre recipe to import the german edition of Le Monde Diplomatique.

Editions are grepped from www.monde-diplomatique.de. The archive contains a list of links to the 12 latest issues. With fetch-lmd.py these limks are extracted and successively written into the file ~/.lmd.date, where it is picked when running calibre-convert.
